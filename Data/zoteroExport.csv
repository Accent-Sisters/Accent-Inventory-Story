Her coach, her guiding light. If she swims well enough, she will be scouted, get a scholarship, go to a good school. Her parents will love her. Her coach will be kind to her. She will have a good life. But these are human concerns. These are the concerns of those confined to land, those with legs. Ren grew up on stories of creatures of the deep, of the oceans and the rivers. Ones that called sailors to their doom. Ones that dragged them down and drowned them. Ones that feasted on their flesh. Ones of the creature that she's always longed to become: mermaid. Ren aches to be in the water. She dreams of the scent of chlorine, the feel of it on her skin. And she will do anything she can to make a life for herself where she can be free. No matter the pain. No matter what anyone else thinks. No matter how much blood she has to spill.""--Book jacket flap","2023","2025-04-21 01:39:20","2025-04-21 01:39:20","","","","","","","","","","","","","William Morrow, an imprint of HarperCollinsPublishers","New York, NY","eng","","","","","Open WorldCat","","OCLC: 1373629489","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","First edition","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"LNMWYBIA","book","2024","Yu, Youyou","Invisible kitties: a feline study of fluid mechanics or the spurious incidents of the cats in the night-time","","978-0-06-333622-3","","","","""In this whimsical and inventive debut-perfect for fans of The Guest Cat and Calvino's Invisible Cities-a young couple's daily life is disrupted by their newly adopted cat, who soon initiates them into the wondrous world of felines. Equal parts magical and humorous, Invisible Kitties tells the story of a young couple that one day accidentally comes into possession of a delightful, playful kitten. Bright eyed and bushy tailed, this new companion, aptly named Cat, upturns the routine of the narrator and her husband in their cramped apartment, and soon they find their existence forever altered as they gradually gain insight into the fantastical world of cats. Every cat contains multitudes... Charting the couple's ever-evolving relationship with cats -some they live with, others who exist solely in their imagination- Invisible Kitties introduces us to a coterie of extraordinary, physics-defying, death-defying cats. They drop from the sky, they grow from the soil, they transmute. They fly, flow, and evaporate. The young couple's everyday life, often eclipsed by the drama of cats, offers a gentle glimpse of how joy can suddenly sneak into our lives. Composed of sixty chapters written in Yu Yoyo's elegant and witty style and complemented by the author's own illustrations- Invisible Kitties is a celebration of ordinary life and the felines we love, deftly playing with the invisible boundaries between reality and imagination.

In the fictional Chinese city of Yong'an, an amateur cryptozoologist is commissioned to uncover the stories of its fabled beasts. These creatures live alongside humans in near-inconspicuousness-save their greenish skin, serrated earlobes, and strange birthmarks. Aided by her elusive former professor and his enigmatic assistant, our narrator sets off to document each beast, and is slowly drawn deeper into a mystery that threatens her very sense of self. Part detective story, part metaphysical inquiry, Strange Beasts of China engages existential questions of identity, humanity, love, and morality with whimsy and stylistic verve.

Selected Poems, translated by Andrea Lingenfelter, is the first comprehensive collection of this important Chinese poet's work to appear in English. Readers can follow the full arc of the poet's career, from the early, surrealist and Deep Image-influenced work of the 1980s, when he made his debut as a post-Misty poet, through the turn toward the rawer, more immediate poetry of the nineties, and on to the existential and ineffable weavings of his more recent work. Wang Yin's sensibility is both cosmopolitan and lyrical, and his poetry has a subtlety and beauty that contrasts with the often physically painful imagery with which he depicts psychological reality, a reality expressed as various states of mind struggling against the suppression of memory. Shanghai winters, a winter in Katowice, a summer day with ghosts, blue shadows, petals in the darkness, an 'empty lane lit up by moonlight'--the poems of this extraordinary volume illuminate the inner life as a singular encounter between physical and spiritual realms""--","2022","2025-04-21 01:40:13","2025-04-21 01:40:13","","","1","","","","","","New York Review Books poets","","","","New York Review Books","New York","eng chi","","","","","K10plus ISBN","","","","","","","","","","Lingenfelter, Andrea","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
